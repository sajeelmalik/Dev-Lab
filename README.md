DevLab is a crowd-sourced platform for learning how to code. As developers, we are often bombarded with an overwhelming flood of resources. DevLab seeks to wade through the flood by providing a robust, user-driven tool to pool the best resources!

* This is a Full-Stack Application powered by Javascript, jQuery, SQL, and node.js. It follows a MVC framework with a RESTful architecture 

# Applied Research and Motivations

![Stack Overflow Study](./public/assets/images/DLresearch.PNG "Stack Overflow Study")

Developers and engineers are constantly seeking and self-learning new technologies. DevLab seeks to provide them the best peer-reviewed content by enabling them to upload, rate, and save the most helpful and effective material.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend Technologies
* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** - Grid and FlexBox
* **Javascript** - the primary scripting logic enabling our application
* **jQuery** - the robust scripting library for Javascript
* [**UIkit**](https://getuikit.com/) - the open-source web styling framework used for structural design, animation, and filter-sorting
* [**Bideo.js**](https://github.com/rishabhp/bideo.js?utm_source=hashnode.com) - responsive video implementation
* [**Moment.js**](momentjs.com) - datetime manipulation
* Paint 3D - icon and image editing

### Backend Technologies and Critical Node Packages

#### Node.js - versatile Javascript runtime 
* **Express.js** - backend server routing framework
* **MySQL2** - server-side relational database usage
* **Sequelize.js** - object-relational mapping (ORM) for SQL
* **Passport.js** - local-strategy login authentication
* **Bcrypt** - two-sided hash encrypting
* **Body Parser, Path** - middleware technology for JSON and expediting filepaths

# Design History 

### Initial Mockups and Wireframe

We initially designed a rough wireframe outlining the core functionality of the application. The user would be able to log-in and parse through a variety of useful material and save the most relevant.

*Design Stage One*

### Final Design Comparisons

The application underwent a rigorous design shift in which a splash page was rendered to comfortably welcome the user to the website.

The main content section additionally went through a design overhaul, and a cleaner, dynamic concept page was created.

# Code Snippets
<!-- put snippets of code inside ``` ``` so it will look like code -->
<!-- if you want to put blockquotes use a > -->

Sorting through user-saved results was a relatively challenging feature to introduce to the application. Initially, we deeply considered an entirely back-end approach where we would run unique SQL queries to order the list items by specific parameters, but that would require a new query each time we required a sorting - breaking the RESTful paradigm to which we were ascribing. Instead, we adopted UIKit's unique filter method and applied a *uk-filter* to the User Library to target each individual item that contained our generated attributes of *data-saves* and *data-date*.

Here is a brief demonstration of the filter-sorting in action:
